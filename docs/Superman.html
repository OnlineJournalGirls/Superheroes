<h1> Superman </h1>
<p> Superman was born on the Planet Krypton but his home was destroyed and so as a baby he was sent to Earth. Superman lived under the alter ego Clark Kent. He used his powers to fight crime in Metropolis. The main villain in the Superman franchise is Lex Luthor who is Superman's main enemy.</p>
<p> Superman was originally created by Jerry Siegal. The art was made by Joe Shuster. Superman has become an iconic superhero. His involvement in so many comics, films and TV shows has moulded the character in so many ways. Superman's interaction with other characters (such as Wonder Woman, Batman, etc.) has evolved his character and made his hole extremely flexible.</p>
