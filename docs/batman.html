<h1>Batman</h1>
<p>Batman is a much darker, grown up look of superhero societies. Bruce Wayne is a multi-millionaire who witnessed his parents being shot as a child. He fights criminals but is not squeaky clean like Superman. The comics are set in Gotham where the town is so corrupted they police are struggling to take down 'the mob' gang. The story of Batman has many dark, twisted, sinister character. The joker, for example, is Batman's arch nemesis who is so scary because of his unpredictability. </p>
