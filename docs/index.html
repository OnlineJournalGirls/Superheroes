	<h2>DC COMICS</h2>

		<div><li><p><b>BATMAN A.K.A BRUCE WAYNE</b><br /><small>Batman is a much darker, grown up look of superhero societies. Bruce Wayne is a multi-millionaire who witnessed his parents being shot as a child. He fights criminals but is not squeeky clean like Superman. The comics are set in Gotham where the town is so corrupted they police are struggling to take down 'the mob' gang. The story of Batman has many dark, twisted, sinister character. The joker, for example, is Batman's archnemesis who is so scary because of his unpredictablitly.</small></p></li></div>
		<div><li><p><b>SUPERMAN A.K.A CLAK KENT</b><br /><small> Superman was born on the Planet Krypton but his home was destroyed and so as a baby he was sent to Earth. Superman lived under the alter ego Clark Kent. He used his powers to fight crime in Metropolis. The main villain in the Superman franchise is Lex Luthor who is Superman's main enemy.Superman was originally created by Jerry Siegal. The art was made by Joe Shuster. Superman has become an iconic superhero. His involvement in so many comics, films and TV shows has moulded the character in so many ways.

	<h2>MARVEL COMICS</h2>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none">
		<div><li><p><b>IRONMAN A.K.A TONY STARK</b><br /><small>Tony Stark is an eccentric billionaire who is very money orientated. Everything for him changed when he was kidnapped and the only way for him to escape was to build a robotic suit. This is where the origin of Ironman began. Now he uses his engineering skills to help protect Earth. The creation of Ironman was by Stan Lee. The character is most notably portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the new Marvel films. Ironman's alternative persona is an important aspect of his character, his moral compass is not perfectly aligned which can cause friction with other heroes.</small></p></li></div>

		<div><li><p><b>CAPTAIN AMERICA A.K.A STEVE ROGERS</b><br /><small>During WWII, Steve Rogers underwent an experimental transformation where he became extremely strong and powerful. This is where he became Captain America and used as the face of American propaganda.

Many years later the block of ice preserving Captain America's body was found and he awoke is a new, modern society. Captain America was created by Joe Simon. The character, like Superman from DC comics, has a strong opinion of his moral compass. This has conflicting views with Ironman resulting in the comic "Civil War".</small></p></li></div>
